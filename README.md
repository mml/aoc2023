Based on
[Matt Might's blog post](https://matt.might.net/articles/26-languages-part1/)
I'm giving the idea of using a different language each day a shot.

1. [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) and
   [dc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_%28computer_program%29).  Both of
   these languages are like mini-assembly languages for their specific domains.
   This combo has lots of power and it's not overwhelmed by the simplicity of
   this challenge.
